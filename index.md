# Final Milestone

I was able to recalibrate my 5 IR sensors in the front of my robot so that it would be able to track the color black better. I also recalibrated my left and right IR sensors that are used to detect objects and make turns based on which IR sensor is activated. I also recalibrated my ultrasonic sensor that is mounted on a servo motor that can make 180 degree turns. I recalibrated theIR this by screwdriving an adjustment part on the board of the IR sensor. For the ultrasonic sensor, I screwed it off the servo motor and reattached it to the servo motor until the ultrasonic sensor faced towards the front of the robot. After that, I swapped the batteries as it provided better power for the motors to work and the wheels to move.

Some things that I struggled with were building and recording because when I was building my robot, I forgot to take a plastic wrap off the chassis and when I did, it made my nuts on my screws be tightened with the pieces in the chassis attached to it. As for the recording process, I had some trouble running the program due to the cloth placed on the table. It also took really long as more small problems arose. Like, my sensors bugging and needing to recalibrate them again. Some triumphs were that I was the first one to have a working starting project which was the Tv B Gone. Also, I learned how to solder wires together and desolder stuff so in the future, those skills will be handy.

One key topic I learned was how to use CAD to create a 3d model and 3d print it. Another key topic I learned was how to use arduino and to use its helpful library to set up some base code. Also, using the arduino to use a bluetooth connection. Furthermore, a key topic about IR sensors is that they're only able to detect the color white and black but only track the black color using infrared radiation.

Something that I want to take away and learn at a future date is what field of engineering I want to focus in. I also want to learn more about coding and what possibilities it can create. I also want to learn more about how each circuit board works and what parts can be attached to it. I wanna know how power works in engineering and what are things you can do to manipulate it.

# Second Milestone
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5VZBuXoUD5s" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

I went to the OSOYOO website and searched up my project which was the OmniWheel Robot. I then downloaded the rest of the remaining codes that were required to perform every
function of the robot. One was to use the UltraSonic sensor and make the robot drive on its own with the sensor correcting its path. The one after that was to make the sensor which was the bumper to only follow the color, black. So then, the two IR sensors were able to detect objects in front and stop and reverse. After that the really important one was the one that allowed you to control the car with bluetooth via phone. You also have to install an app so you connect the robot to the app. After that, it was all under my control and it was fun. This will help with my final milestone as the pavement is mostly white and the sensor on the bumper will need to change to follow the color white.

Something surprising was the many things you could do with parts that are on the robot. I may have downloaded prewritten code but that doesn't mean I can't write code of my own. Also on how much an arduino board is able to process and act on code. Another thing that was surprising is how easily you're able to forget things that you did with your jumper wires. 

I was able to overcome a challenge during my recording session of my second milestone. The challenge was that the code wasn't working even though the robot responded to it and the bluetooth connection was stable. So I inputted the code again and everything showed that it was fine except one thing. It wasn't making a noise when the engine turned on. This told me that the wires had to be in the wrong spot and I checked and they were. After that, I was able to record my second milestone video.

I will need to learn how arduino works in order to get the basis down so I can program my sensor to follow the color white. Also, research if my sensor is able to change colors since it's an OSOYOO component so it might be built in like that. I will also need to come up with second and third milestone ideas just in case it isn't possible. Furthermore, I need to control my time management better.

# First Milestone
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1yABNRUPLds" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

My intensive project is called the Omni wheel robot and it can move in any direction. It can move in every direction possible and the most impressive movement to me is moving horizontally due to the specific design of the wheels. The Acrylic chassis is the base in which all the different components come together to create the robot. We first need to work on the bottom part of the chassis. We need to connect the four motors and to do that, you need to screw in some metal holders to attach the motors to the bottom chassis. After that, we first need to screw in the Model Y Board 2.0 onto the chassis, then we can attach the motor's 2 pins jumper wires to the correct spaces on the board. We then use plastic screws to attach the tracking sensor module to the front of the chassis. Next, we screw six copper on the bottom chassis. We then focus on working on the top part of the chassis and attach the Mega2560 board to it by screwing it. We then add on the uart wifi shield and connect to the Mega board as well as screwing on the servo motor on the bottom of the top chassis piece. In the same way, we attach two IR obstacle avoidance sensors on the top part of the chassis. After this, we use jumper wires to connect the boards on the bottom chassis to the board on the top chassis going through the holes. We can begin working on a separate piece where it goes between the two chassis parts. The piece requires that you attach 2 LED lights to a mount by screwing it in. Then, we can finally screw the top and bottom pieces of the chassis with the LED mount in the middle with another mount in the back of the robot. We add more jumper wires to connect pieces of the Model Y Board 2.0 and the uart wifi board. Finally, we use the motor flexible couplers to attach the wheel to the motor that is attached to the bottom chassis and then screw the wheel in.

I then installed Arduino and the lessons that the OSOYOO recommended to install and I ended up installing one lesson in the arduino board that was on the robot.

Some challenges that I faced were reading the schematic and following the video tutorial. It showed different steps of the schematics and also the video wasn't really descriptive about which piece goes to what is also the same with the schematic pictures. Another problem that I encountered was trying to put on the nuts on the screw but sometimes the nuts wouldn't want to screw tightly.  I think the wire management is not necessary to fix but I want the robot to look clean. 

There are still some other parts to install but I managed to install the base components of the robot that were necessary for it to run. I will continue to follow the other lessons and install the parts that those lessons say to do.

# Starter Project
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/apvSCtjpW8Q" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen> </iframe>

-My starter project was the TV B Gone and its purpose was to send a lot of random code in order to shut off any TV. The reason why I picked this specific starter project was because I kept losing my times of peace on my bed. I would work my way up to have peaceful naps or just a nice 8 hour sleep. I would work on the temperature in the room so that my body was able to enter a sort of hibernation state. All this hard work would be eventually ruined as I needed to turn off my TV to sleep. I would always lose the remote control and spend two minutes finding it and thus ruin my sleep. 

Some challenges that I faced was a soldering problem and user error. I soldered this LED in the wrong orientation and it took a while to desolder the LED. However this still hadn’t worked and I was asked to bring it home to test it. I did and it didn’t work, so the next day I was given a new starter project. After this, I was bummed it didn't work and started to work on the new starter project but while I was reading the instructions, I realized a part labeled IC had two parts to it. The IC socket and the IC itself, with this new knowledge acquired, I was able to put a missing part on the TV B Gone. The green LED started blinking once I did which it had never done before and once again I was given permission to test it out at home. It actually worked and I was the first one in my class to make a working TV B Gone. This definitely left a lesson for me and that was to read the instructions very carefully.

<!---# Other Resources/Examples
One of the best parts about Github is that you can view how other people set up their own work. Here are some past BSE portfolios that are awesome examples. You can view how they set up their portfolio, and you can view their index.md files to understand how they implemented different portfolio components.
- [Example 1](https://trashytuber.github.io/YimingJiaBlueStamp/)
- [Example 2](https://sviatil0.github.io/Sviatoslav_BSE/)
- [Example 3](https://arneshkumar.github.io/arneshbluestamp/)
