<!---Replace this text with a brief description (2-3 sentences) of your project. This description should draw the reader in and make them interested in what you've built. You can include what the biggest challenges, takeaways, and triumphs from completing the project were. As you complete your portfolio, remember your audience is less familiar than you are with all that your project entails!-->

<# First Milestone

My intensive project is called the Omni wheel robot and it can move in any direction. It can move in every direction possible and the most impressive movement to me is moving horizontally due to the specific design of the wheels. The Acrylic chassis is the base in which all the different components come together to create the robot. We first need to work on the bottom part of the chassis. We need to connect the four motors and to do that, you need to screw in some metal holders to attach the motors to the bottom chassis. After that, we first need to screw in the Model Y Board 2.0 onto the chassis, then we can attach the motor's 2 pins jumper wires to the correct spaces on the board. We then use plastic screws to attach the tracking sensor module to the front of the chassis. Next, we screw six copper on the bottom chassis. We then focus on working on the top part of the chassis and attach the Mega2560 board to it by screwing it. We then add on the uart wifi shield and connect to the Mega board as well as screwing on the servo motor on the bottom of the top chassis piece. In the same way, we attach two IR obstacle avoidance sensors on the top part of the chassis. After this, we use jumper wires to connect the boards on the bottom chassis to the board on the top chassis going through the holes. We can begin working on a separate piece where it goes between the two chassis parts. The piece requires that you attach 2 LED lights to a mount by screwing it in. Then, we can finally screw the top and bottom pieces of the chassis with the LED mount in the middle with another mount in the back of the robot. We add more jumper wires to connect pieces of the Model Y Board 2.0 and the uart wifi board. Finally, we use the motor flexible couplers to attach the wheel to the motor that is attached to the bottom chassis and then screw the wheel in. I then installed Arduino and the lessons that the robot came with but only used 1 of them. Some challenges that I faced were reading the schematic and following the video tutorial. It showed different parts at different times but I was able to complete the build without any further incidents. The wire management is not necessary to fix but I want the robot to look clean. I will install the other parts correlated with the lessons.

<!---# Schematics 
Here's where you'll put images of your schematics. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/official-guide-to-tinkercad-circuits) and [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/learning/) are both great resoruces to create professional schematic diagrams, though BSE recommends Tinkercad becuase it can be done easily and for free in the browser.--> 

<!---# Code
Here's where you'll put your code. The syntax below places it into a block of code. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize it to your project needs. 

```c++
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Hello World!");
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}

<!---# Other Resources/Examples
One of the best parts about Github is that you can view how other people set up their own work. Here are some past BSE portfolios that are awesome examples. You can view how they set up their portfolio, and you can view their index.md files to understand how they implemented different portfolio components.
- [Example 1](https://trashytuber.github.io/YimingJiaBlueStamp/)
- [Example 2](https://sviatil0.github.io/Sviatoslav_BSE/)
- [Example 3](https://arneshkumar.github.io/arneshbluestamp/)
